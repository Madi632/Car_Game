# Car_Game by Madison Lewis. 
Made in Unity.

A simple car game where you collect packages and deliver them to three people.

Little Miss Driver just got her first job: A delivery girl. How wonderful! But while doing so, she accidentally dropped her packages all over the road. Now that's no good.

Use the left and right arrow keys to turn your car around while using the up and down keys to go forward and backwards respectively. Once you get a package, your car
(mysteriously) turns a cute shade of purple, but when you give the package to the people that need it, your car changes back to normal. There are also speed tiles that 
makes you go fast, but watch out for the trees and rocks along the road. They can hurt you pretty bad.

Go on now girly pop! Show the world you can drive (resposibly) AND look cool doing it!
